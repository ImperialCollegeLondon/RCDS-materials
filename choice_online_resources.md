# Choice online resources

Several [online
courses](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/success-guide/ug/effective-study/working-by-yourself/learning-online/online-courses/)
have been developed by Imperial departments. We also list external
resources.

To take a course on [edX](https://www.edx.org/school/imperialx) for
free, simply sign up using the ‘Audit this course’ option.

On [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/imperial), select ‘Enroll for
free’ and, depending on the course, select the ‘Audit’ option, the ‘Full
course, no certificate’ option or the ‘Try for Free’ option.

<td><strong>Object-oriented Programming in Python for
Mathematicians</strong> (David Ham, Imperial College)</td>
<td><p><a href="https://object-oriented-python.github.io">Home
page</a></p>
<p>This book is the result of a significant change in the mathematics
curriculum at Imperial College London. Rather than assume that students
will somehow acquire programming skills along the way, we have
introduced first and second year courses with the sole objective of
teaching students to programme well. This book is the text for the
second of these courses. Named “Principles of Programming”, the course
aims to take students with a knowledge of basic Python programming
(functions, loops, plotting and so forth) and introduce them to higher
level programming concepts.</p></td>
